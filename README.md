# My Rust Learning Roadmap

This repository is my personal roadmap for learning Rust. It is structured into five key steps, each with its own directory, to help me understand rust and build practical projects.

---

## **Steps Overview**

1. **Language Syntax Exploration** ([Directory](./1-language-syntax)) (5 hours)
2. **Rustlings Exercises** ([Directory](./2-rustlings)) (10 hours)
3. **Advent of Code Problems** ([Directory](./3-advent-of-code)) (10 hours)
4. **WebSocket Chat Client** ([Directory](./4-ws-chat-client)) (10 hours)
5. **Small Project** ([Directory](./5-small-project)) (17 hours)

---

### **Step 1: Language Syntax Exploration** (5 hours)

- Skim through the official [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to explore the core syntax and concepts of Rust.
- Focus on:
  - Variables, functions, control flow, and ownership.
  - Structs, enums, traits, generics, and error handling.

- Save my findings in the [language syntax directory](./language-syntax).

#### **Tasks**
1. **Variables and Functions** (1 hour)
   - Write small test programs that use variables and functions.
   - Document code with comments explaining concepts like mutability and shadowing.

2. **Control Flow** (1 hour)
   - Create examples for `if`, `else`, `match`, and loops.
   - Include documentation for when to use each structure.

3. **Ownership and Borrowing** (1 hours)
   - Write programs demonstrating ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
   - Include comments to explain Rust's memory management model.

4. **Structs and Enums** (1 hours)
   - Implement examples for defining and using structs and enums.
   - Document how they can be used to model data effectively.

5. **Traits and Generics** (1 hour)
   - Write examples of traits and generic functions.
   - Document their purpose and advantages.

### **Step 2: Rustlings Exercises** (10 hours)

- Use [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) to reinforce my understanding of Rust basics through hands-on exercises.

#### **Tasks**
1. Complete the following sections in Rustlings:
   - **Variables** (? hours)
   - **Ownership** (? hours)
   - **Enums** (? hours)
   - **Traits** (? hours)
   - **Miscellaneous exercises** (? hours)

2. Save my solutions in the [rustlings directory](./rustlings).

### **Step 3: Advent of Code Problems** (10 hours)

- Solve real-world programming challenges to deepen my understanding of Rust techniques.

#### **Tasks**
1. Solve 10 problems from [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024):
   - Problem 1 (1 hour)
   - Problem 2 (1 hour)
   - Problem 3 (1 hour)
   - Problem 4 (1 hour)
   - Problem 5 (1 hour)
   - Problem 6 (1 hour)
   - Problem 7 (1 hour)
   - Problem 8 (1 hour)
   - Problem 9 (1 hour)
   - Problem 10 (1 hour)
2. Save my solutions in the [Advent of Code directory](./advent-of-code).

### **Step 4: WebSocket Chat Client** (10 hours)

- Build a basic [WebSocket-based chat client](./ws-chat-client) using async Rust. 

#### **Tasks**
1. **Setup WebSocket Connection** (2 hours)
   - Research libraries like `tokio` and `async-tungstenite`.
   - Establish a WebSocket connection.

2. **Send and Receive Messages** (2 hours)
   - Implement message sending and receiving.
   - Test the functionality with a simple server.

3. **Command Handling** (3 hours)
   - Add commands for user input (e.g., `/quit` to exit).
   - Improve the user interface with clear prompts.

4. **Refinement and Testing** (3 hours)
   - Test for edge cases and fix bugs.
   - Refactor the code for readability and efficiency.

---

### **Step 5: Small Project** (10 hours)

- Apply my Rust knowledge to build a mini text-based adventure game.

#### **Tasks**
1. **Game Design and Story** (2 hours)
   - Design the structure of the game.
   - Write a simple story with multiple paths.

2. **Input Handling** (2 hours)
   - Implement user input to navigate the game.
   - Use `match` to handle different commands.

3. **Game Logic** (9 hours)
   - Create the game logic for progressing through the story.
   - Include inventory management or simple puzzles.

4. **Testing and Refinement** (3 hours)
   - Test the game for bugs and improve the user experience.
   - Refactor the code for clarity.

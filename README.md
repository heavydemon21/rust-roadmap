# My Rust Learning Roadmap

This repository is my personal roadmap for learning Rust. It is structured into five key steps, each with its own directory, to help me systematically master Rust and build practical projects.

---

## **Steps Overview**

1. **Language Syntax Exploration** ([Directory](./1-language-syntax))
2. **Rustlings Exercises** ([Directory](./2-rustlings))
3. **Advent of Code Problems** ([Directory](./3-advent-of-code))
4. **WebSocket Chat Client** ([Directory](./4-ws-chat-client))
5. **Small Project** ([Directory](./5-small-project))

---

### **Step 1: Language Syntax Exploration**

- Explore the core syntax and concepts of Rust.
- Focus on:
  - Variables, functions, control flow, and ownership.
  - Structs, enums, traits, generics, and error handling.

#### **Tasks**
1. Follow the examples and explanations in the [language syntax directory](./1-language-syntax).
2. Complete the provided code challenges.

---

### **Step 2: Rustlings Exercises**

- Use [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) to reinforce my understanding of Rust basics through hands-on exercises.

#### **Setup**
1. Clone the Rustlings repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings.git
   cd rustlings
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the Rustlings README to install and start.

#### **Tasks**
1. Complete at least the following sections in Rustlings:
   - Variables
   - Ownership
   - Enums
   - Traits

See the [Rustlings directory](./2-rustlings) for progress tracking and additional notes.

---

### **Step 3: Advent of Code Problems**

- Solve real-world programming challenges to deepen my understanding of Rust techniques.

#### **Tasks**
1. Solve 10 problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
2. Focus on applying Rustâ€™s unique features like iterators and error handling.
3. Save my solutions in the [Advent of Code directory](./3-advent-of-code).

---

### **Step 4: WebSocket Chat Client**

- Build a basic WebSocket-based chat client using async Rust.

#### **Tasks**
1. Research libraries like `tokio` and `async-tungstenite`.
2. Implement a WebSocket connection to send and receive messages.
3. Test the client and refine the user experience.
4. See the [WebSocket Chat Client directory](./4-ws-chat-client) for a detailed guide.

---

### **Step 5: Small Project**

- Apply my Rust knowledge to build a small standalone project. Suggested ideas:
  - CLI Habit Tracker
  - File Organizer
  - Todo List App

#### **Tasks**
1. Choose a project idea from the [Small Project directory](./5-small-project).
2. Plan, implement, and polish the project.
3. Save the final code and a README in the directory.

### **Reflection**
After completing each step, I'll reflect on what I learned and identify areas for improvement to guide my next steps in learning Rust.

### **Happy Learning!**
